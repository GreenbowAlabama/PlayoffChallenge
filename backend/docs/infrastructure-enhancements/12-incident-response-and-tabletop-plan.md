# 12 - Incident Response & Tabletop Exercise Plan

## Status
Planned (Post-Demo, Code Freeze Safe)

## Executive Summary

Establish a formal Incident Response (IR) plan and conduct recurring tabletop exercises to validate operational readiness.

This ensures the platform can respond effectively to:
- Production outages
- Data integrity issues
- Payment failures
- Security incidents
- Lifecycle reconciliation errors

---

## Objectives

1. Define clear severity levels (SEV-1 to SEV-4)
2. Define ownership and escalation paths
3. Establish communication protocol
4. Define containment and recovery procedures
5. Conduct quarterly tabletop simulations

---

## Deliverables

- Written Incident Response Runbook
- Severity classification matrix
- Communication templates
- Postmortem template
- Tabletop scenario scripts

---

## Tabletop Scenarios (Initial Set)

1. Stripe webhook outage
2. Database corruption scenario
3. Lifecycle reconciler malfunction
4. Unauthorized admin action
5. Payment intent mismatch

---

## Success Criteria

- Response time < defined SLA
- Clear role ownership during simulation
- Actionable postmortems
- Identified infrastructure gaps documented

---

## Risk Level

Low implementation risk.
High operational value.
